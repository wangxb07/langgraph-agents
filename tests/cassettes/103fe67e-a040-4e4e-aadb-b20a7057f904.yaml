        to production-ready applications.[5]\nIntegrations[edit]\nAs of March 2023,
        LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and
        Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information, and
        weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
        of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot
        learning prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \"todo\" tasks
        in code; Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization,
        extraction, and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI,
        Anthropic, and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis

        time zone conversion and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack
        symbols in threaded and asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha
        website and SDK.[8] As a language model integration framework, LangChain''s
        use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including
        document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\nHistory[edit]\nLangChain
        was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase,
        while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023,
        LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in
        funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia
        Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\n
        The project quickly garnered popularity, with improvements from hundreds of
        contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on
        the project''s Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San
        Francisco and London. As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document
        types and data sources.[9]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]","score":0.99694854,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Harrison
